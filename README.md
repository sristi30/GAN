#GAN Mnist.ipynb

The program generates MNIST data by the use of GAN. Most parts of the code is taken from https://medium.com/ai-society/gans-from-scratch-1-a-deep-introduction-with-code-in-pytorch-and-tensorflow-cb03cdcdba0f 
Comments are added for better understanding.
The program doesn't make log files and displays the generated images in successive steps by matplotlib.
